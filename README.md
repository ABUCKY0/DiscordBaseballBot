# DiscordBaseballBot
Posts baseball game updates to a discord channel

This is a working project to create a baseball updater bot to post game updates in a Discord channel.
This will rely heavily from the [reddit baseball updater bot](https://github.com/mattabullock/Baseball-GDT-Bot)
that posted to reddit threads. It will also rely on python discord bots that already exist.  

Please do not expect tests or regular updates, this is a pet project moreso as a proof of concept than 
anything well maintained.  If there si interest in it, I will expand it out to make it customizable
and easier to use.

  Starting a new project, only a readme.  Goal #1 is to get this to post to a discord server of my choosing.
